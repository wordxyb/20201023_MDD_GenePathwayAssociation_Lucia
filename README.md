# 20201023_MDD_GenePathwayAssociation_Lucia

Introduction: On 20201023 I got this dataset from Na. It includes the results from gene/pathway association analysis and clustering results in terms of MDD generated by Lucia Trastulla.

There are results for lifetime MDD and recur MDD for each analysis.

File Data_Lucia

- samples_bridgeIDs_ukb2412_ukb34217 bridge samples IDs between our projects.


- clustering_Cases contain the clustering results using
    - DLPC_CMC: Dorso Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPC_CMC) from Common Mind
    - Whole_Blood: Whole Blood from GTEx
    - SNFcombined: both tissues integrated via Similarity Network Fusion (SNFcombined)

    among those columns, tscore, path_Reactome and path_GO are three pathways.


- covariateMatrix_ contain additional info on individuals (PCs, Age, Gender)


- tscore_pval, path_Reactome_pval, path_GO_pval contain the summary statistic for the association of genes and pathway. 

For the pathway analysis, the column 'ngenes_tscore' contains the number of genes used to compute the pathway score, we excluded the pathway that are composed of only 1 gene to perform the clustering.

Data edited by me. Operations including merge Lucia's datasets with what we have, etc.
File 1_ .... 9_

GWAS analysis for each cluster against the rest on each pathway.
Also, I performed the downstream analysis such as LDSC, GeneticCorrelation etc.
